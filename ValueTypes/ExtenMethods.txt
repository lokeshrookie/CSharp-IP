The magic of extension methods in C# is that they allow methods defined in a static class to be called as if they were instance methods of the type they're extending. Let's break this down step-by-step to clarify how it works.

How Extension Methods Work
1. Static Class: Extension methods must be defined in a static class.
2. Static Method: The method itself must be static.
3. this Keyword: The first parameter of the static method specifies the type it extends, prefixed with the this keyword.

point 3 is very important. "this string name" indicates that method extends the 'string' type.

Example: ExtensionMethods.cs 

To use the extension method defined in ExtensionMethods.cs:

using System;
using CustomExtensions; // Include the namespace where the extension method is defined

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        string sentence = "Hello, how are you doing today?";
        int count = sentence.WordCount(); // Call the extension method as if it's an instance method
        Console.WriteLine($"Word count: {count}");
    }
}
